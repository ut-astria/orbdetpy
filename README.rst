orbdetpy - Orbit determination in Python and Java
=================================================

Introduction
------------

This is orbdetpy, a library of Python and Java routines for orbit
determination. It is a thin Python wrapper for our estimation tools
and Orekit, which are both written in Java. 

orbdetpy is free software, distributed under the terms of the `GNU
General Public License <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>`_.

Features
--------

The force model for orbit propagation currently includes:

1. EGM96 gravity field up to degree and order 360.
2. Earth solid tides due to the influence of the Sun and Moon.
3. FES 2004 ocean tide model up to degree and order 100.
4. The NRL MSISE-00 and simple exponential models for atmospheric drag.
5. Solar radiation pressure.
6. Third body perturbations from the Sun and Moon.

The measurement model supports range, range-rate, angles, and inertial
Cartesian coordinates. Filtering is done using Orekit's Extended Kalman
Filter or our custom Unscented Kalman Filter. Dynamic Model Compensation
(DMC) can be used with either filter to estimate additional perturbing
acclerations that result from unmodeled dynamics, maneuvers etc.

You can either use your own measurements or simulate observations using
the ``simulateMeasurements()`` function.

Installation
------------

``orbdetpy`` requires ``pyjnius``, which requires the Java Development
Kit 8+ and ``Cython`` to install.

1. Install the Java Development Kit 8+ (1.8+) from `here
   <http://openjdk.java.net>`_
2. Set the ``JAVA_HOME`` environment variable to point to your JDK
   installation.
3. Add ``$JAVA_HOME\bin`` and ``$JAVA_HOME\jre\bin\server`` to your
   ``PATH`` evironment variable
4. Install ``Cython``::

    pip install cython
    
5. Install ``orbdetpy`` with Python 3.6 or later::

    git clone https://github.com/ut-astria/orbdetpy
    pip install orbdetpy

The ``lib/`` folder contains JAR files for the following libraries, which are
imported by orbdetpy automatically.

1. `Google gson <https://github.com/google/gson>`_
2. `Hipparchus 1.4+ <https://hipparchus.org>`_ 
3. `Orekit 9.3+ <https://www.orekit.org>`_

Space weather data in ``data/`` is obtained from
`CelesTrak <http://www.celestrak.com/SpaceData/>`_.

Examples
--------

The following example programs can be found in the 'examples' folder.
These examples use the Python wrapper interface but calling the
underlying Java implementation directly is quite straightforward.

1) testsim.py : Demonstrates the measurement simulator. Note that
   maneuvers can be incorporated into the force model during simulation.

2) plotsim.py : Plots the results of simulations created using testsim.py.

3) testodet.py : Demonstrates orbit determination in orbdetpy.

4) plotodet.py : Plots the results of fitting orbits using testodet.py.

orbdetpy uses JSON files to store settings, measurements and estimation
results. The files in examples/data show how to configure measurement
simulation and orbit determination using radar or telescope data. The
file docs/filefmt.rst documents the structure of the JSON files.

The following are some typical use cases. It is assumed that the current
working directory is examples/data.

1) Simulate state vectors and radar measurements::

    python ../testsim.py radar_sim_cfg.json sim_data.json

   This will run the simulation configured in radar_sim_cfg.json and
   write simulated output to sim_data.json.

2) Plot simulation results::

    python ../plotsim.py radar_sim_cfg.json sim_data.json

   This will plot the simulated data generated in (1).

3) Run OD on simulated radar data::

    python ../testodet.py radar_od_cfg.json sim_data.json od_output.json

   This will run OD on the simulated radar data generated in (1)
   using the OD configuration in radar_od_cfg.json and write OD
   output to od_output.json.

4) Plot OD results::

    python ../plotodet.py radar_od_cfg.json sim_data.json od_output.json

   This will plot the OD results from (3).

Future Work
-----------

The following tasks are under consideration. Community contributions are
always welcome.

1) A batch least squares implementation.
2) Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother.
3) Parametric analysis i.e. the ability to pass-through certain
   measurement types.

Bug Reports
-----------

Comments, criticisms and bug reports are very welcome and may be sent to
the package maintainer by email or the project's website.
